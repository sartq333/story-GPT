# story-GPT
A simple GPT model trained from scratch on [tiny stories dataset](https://huggingface.co/roneneldan/TinyStories-33M/tree/main). Most of the code in this repository has been inspired from this [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/heyytanay/gpt-from-scratch-using-lightning-and-lance/notebook) so do check it out.

Future Work:

I'll also replace the use of tiktoken in this code to make it completely independent and for that I'll probably be using [this](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe).
