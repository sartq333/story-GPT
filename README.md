# story-GPT
A simple GPT model trained from scratch on [tiny stories dataset](https://huggingface.co/roneneldan/TinyStories-33M/tree/main). Most of the code in this repository has been inspired from this [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/heyytanay/gpt-from-scratch-using-lightning-and-lance/notebook) so do check it out. It took around 5 hours to train the model for 50 epochs on a P100.

Future Work:

Replace the use of tiktoken in this code to make it completely independent by probably using [this](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe).

A simple gradio UI/host on huggingface space (whichever is more convinent).

I've a couple of more things in my mind to improve this. Will be adding them in the future scope of work for this project if it is feasible to work on those (like dockerization and jit compilation to improve inference).
